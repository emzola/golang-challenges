# Golang Projects

A repository for my solutions to simple golang challenges

## Challenges

### 1. Tip Calculator

Create a simple tip calculator. The program should prompt for a bill amount and a tip rate. The program must compute the tip and then display both the tip and the total amount of the bill.

### 2. Saying Hello

Create a program that prompts for your name and prints a greeting using your name.
Example Output:

> What is your name? Brian
>
> Hello, Brian, nice to meet you!

**Constraints**

Keep the input, string concatenation, and output separate.

### 3. Counting the Number of Characters

Create a program that prompts for an input string and displays output that shows the input string and the number of characters the string contains.
Example Output:

> What is the input string? Homer
>
> Homer has 5 characters.

**Constraints**

- Be sure the output contains the original string.
- Use a single output statement to construct the output.
- Use a built-in function of the programming language to determine the length of the string.
