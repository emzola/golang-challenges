# Simple Golang Challenges

A repository of my solution to simple golang challenges

## Challenges

### 1. Tip Calculator

### 2. Saying Hello

Example Output:

> What is your name? Brian
>
> Hello, Brian, nice to meet you!

**Constraints**

Keep the input, string concatenation, and output separate.

### 3. Counting the Number of Characters

Example Output:

> What is the input string? Homer
>
> Homer has 5 characters.

**Constraints**

- Be sure the output contains the original string.
- Use a single output statement to construct the output.
- Use a built-in function of the programming language to determine the length of the string.
- If the user enters nothing, state that the user must enter something into the program.

### 4. Printing Quotes

Example Output:

> What is the quote? These aren't the droids you're looking for.
>
> Who said it? Obi-Wan Kenobi
>
> Obi-Wan Kenobi says, "These aren't the droids you're looking for."

**Constraints**

- Use a single output statement to produce this output, using appropriate string-escaping techniques for quotes.
- If your language supports string interpolation or string substitution, donâ€™t use it for this exercise. Use string concatenation instead.

**Challenge**: Modify the program so that instead of prompting for quotes from the user, you create a structure that holds quotes and their associated attributions and then display all of the quotes using the format in the example.
